== Changelog ==

= 2.1.1 - 2021-09-16 =
* UPDATE: PHP 8 now officially supported.
* UPDATE: updated .pot file for translations.

= 2.1.0 - 2021-04-15 =
* NEW: added more options to "validate image dimensions" setting: "greater than or equal", and "less than or equal".
* NEW: added button to delete file attachments on admin "edit order" page. (If you don't want the ability to delete files, you can use the filter `wpwham_checkout_files_upload_allow_admin_delete_files` to disable it).
* FIX: check if server's temporary directory is writeable. If not, display an error message. (Solves an issue with 0-byte files being uploaded).
* FIX: bug where sometimes 0-byte files were attached to order emails.
* UPDATE: for text labels/notices, made it possible for a translated string to take precedence over stored settings. (Previously it was the other way around. This should now make things easier if you use a translation plugin like LocoTranslate, Polylang, etc).
* UPDATE: performance improvement -- load our admin assets only when needed.
* UPDATE: updated .pot file for translations.

= 2.0.4 - 2021-01-12 =
* FIX: clean output buffer before downloads (solves conflict with some 3rd-party plugins which interfere with the output buffer, causing downloads to appear as empty or corrupt).

= 2.0.3 - 2020-09-17 =
* UPDATE: display our settings in WC status report.

= 2.0.2 - 2020-08-21 =
* FIX: upload button translation issue (removed old label settings, added new ones).
* UPDATE: updated .pot file for translations.

= 2.0.1 - 2020-06-17 =
* FIX: issue with upload button not working in certain themes.
* FIX: user permissions issue incorrectly preventing downloading of images from the WP admin side.
* FIX: JS typo.

= 2.0.0 - 2020-06-11 =
* NEW: **Breaking Change** the `Form (simple)` template has been removed, and `Form (AJAX)` is now the standard template. `Form (AJAX)` has been the default since v1.4.0 (2018-08-25), so for most people this change will have no effect.  However, if you were using `Form (simple)`, or if you had customized either template, please double check your settings to make sure things look correct. Or, you can reset the settings to get a fresh start.
* NEW: **Breaking Change** in template settings, the variable `%field_html%` which previously contained BOTH the field html AND the upload button itself, has been split into separate variables `%field_html%` and `%button_html%`.  Your template settings will be updated automatically to reflect this.
* NEW: image thumbnails will be shown by default.  The image feature has existed since v1.4.0 (2018-08-25), but some people didn't realize this and/or didn't know they needed to add `%image%` into the template to enable it.  Now `%image%` is included in the template by default.  If you don't want this, simply edit your template settings and remove the `%image%` variable.
* NEW: show spinner when processing, and prevent checkout form submission before upload is completed.
* UPDATE: change the way we handle sessions -- only start them when needed, not on every page load.
* UPDATE: extensive code refactoring.
* UPDATE: updated some styling and text.  For example, progress bars (if enabled) are now green.
* UPDATE: updated .pot file for translations.
